* WRA 410 CRUD ASSIGNMENT
* For my WRA 410 Crud assignment I created a blog that can create posts and comments. My two objects I created were my posts and comments features on the blog, for the posts feature there are three different variables (Name, body and topic ) and for the comments feature you have the option to add a numbered post a body and finally a date. To implement these I scaffolded them and created them as strings, text and integers. To design my blog I used html and css, I downloaded bootstrap within my html to further allow my design to function. I was not able to change the default homepage because my version of Ruby would not allow me to tamper with the routes.rb file.

* To install this assignment you will have to make a clone from my github at https://github.com/pete1199/finalcrud.git with Ruby on Rails you can then visit my blog at localhost3000/posts. 

 * This project was built with Ruby on Rails version 2.2.2
